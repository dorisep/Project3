# Project3

Project 3 proposal:

Analyzing Trump twitter archive using NLP Sklearn

Group: Hailu Sefera, Taiwo Onitiri, Edward Doris

We will provide an analysis of President Trumps twitter archive. This archive is significant because of its volume and also presents challenges in identifying stop words and predicting sentiment. We will use Mongo to collect and clean the data along with the pandas library. Sklearn and NLTK will be our ML libraries. This project will use four models: Random Forest, LinearSVC, MultinomialNB and LogisticRegression.
